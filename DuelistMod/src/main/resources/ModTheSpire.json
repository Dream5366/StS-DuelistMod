This has forced the cards in the compendium to separate into 3 different pools - find YGO cards now in the tabs 'The Duelist', 'Duelist_traps', and 'Duelist_spells'.\n- Added 2 new cards: Golden Apples, Sphere Kuriboh\n- Added Challenge Mode: changes the random pools of buffs and orbs, your starting max summons is 4, the Millennium Puzzle special effects are turned off and instead you start battle with 2 Exploding Tokens, and various other challenge increases\n- Added 2 new starting decks: Increment Deck, Exodia Deck\n- Summoner orb now summons Spellcaster Tokens when Challenge Mode is turned off\n- Translations updates for keywords\n- Added translations for all character text in game\n- Fixed Chinese-only orbCard problem, orb deck wasn't letting you choose anything but Lightning\n- Tidied up the summon list coloring function, tokens should be more clearly colored now\n\n\nThanks for playing the Duelist! Please let me know if you have any feedback or bug reports!\nEmail: nyoxidestsmods@gmail.com\nDiscord: Nyoxide#3464",
