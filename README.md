# StS-DuelistMod
A Slay the Spire adaptation of Yu-Gi-Oh!

TODO
- Make cards say Monster/Spell/Trap in-game
- Add character sprite/button/overall thematic art
- Design and add some relics
- Finish implementing rest of the cards (33/112 planned)
- Balance and QA

Some in game screenshots taken of the first build with full card set + all descriptions. Mana costs are not correct and everything is obviously subject to change.
